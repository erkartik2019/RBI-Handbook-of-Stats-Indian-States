## üìê Project Design Approach

- **Star Schema** with Fact and Dimension tables
- **Dimensional modeling** of states and fiscal years
- **Normalized indicators**: Power availability and Highway density
- **Composite Index**: Infrastructure Index = 0.4 √ó Highway Density + 0.6 √ó Power Availability
- **Cross-page interactivity**: Synced slicers, drillthroughs, dynamic tooltips
- **Executive-level layout**: 8 structured report pages with narrative flow
